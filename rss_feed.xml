         <title>Watch &quot;The Model That Changes Everything: Alpaca Breakthrough (ft. Apple's LLM, BritGPT, Ernie and AlexaTM)&quot; on YouTube</title>
         <link>https://youtu.be/xslW5sQOkC8</link>
         <description>8 years of cost reduction in 5 weeks: how Stanford's Alpaca model changes everything, including the economics of OpenAI and GPT 4. The breakthrough, using self-instruct, has big implications for Apple's secret large language model, Baidu's ErnieBot, Amazon's attempts and even governmental efforts, like the newly announced BritGPT.

I will go through how Stanford put the model together, why it costs so little, and demonstrate in action versus Chatgpt and GPT 4. And what are the implications of short-circuiting human annotation like this? With analysis of a tweet by Eliezer Yudkowsky, I delve into the workings of the model and the questions it rises.

         <link>https://www.macdrifter.com/2021/11/some-obsidian-shortcuts-and-a-macro.html</link>
         <description>One major shortcoming of Obsidian is that it does not integrate well with macOS or iOS so there are no conveniences for capturing text into an Obsidian note. I decided to learn a bit about the Obsidian URL scheme (which works on macOS and iOS) and create some Shortcuts to fill in the gap. New Obsidian Note This is a simple Shortcut that has one purpose: Give me a simple and convenient window to create a new Obsidian note on macOS and iOS.</description>

Lyrics:
Grandma used to pray out loud
By her bed every night
To me it sounded like mumbling
Like she was out of her mind
She said boy this kind of praying is what saved my life
You oughta try it some time
Now I know she was right

She was talking to Jesus
She was talking to Jesus
She‚Äôd been talking to Jesus for all of her life

Mama used to drag me to church
Sunday mornings and Wednesday night
Khaki pants and a polo shirt
Boy I put up a fight
She said, son, one day you‚Äôll thank me for having God in your life
And yeah I know she was right
Yeah my mama was right

Cause now I‚Äôm talking to Jesus
She got me talking to Jesus
She got me talking to Jesus
Yeah my mama was right
Cause now I‚Äôm talking to Jesus
Yeah I love talking to Jesus
And I'll be talking to Jesus
For the rest of my life

What a friend we have in Jesus
What a friend we have in Jesus
What a friend we have in Jesus
Oh

I've got 3 of my own now
Trying to raise them up right
My oldest is 15 and I remember what that was like
Trying to deal with the drama, trying to figure out the questions in life
I‚Äôve been looking for a way to show him how to make it alright

Then he walked in my room while I was saying my prayers the other night
He said I‚Äôll come back later, I can tell you got a lot on your mind
I said it‚Äôs not an interruption, you couldn‚Äôt have picked a better time
Cause I was just talking to Jesus, come over and give it a try

We started talking to Jesus
We started talking to Jesus
We started talking to Jesus
Oh
And now he‚Äôs talking to Jesus
Thank God he‚Äôs talking to Jesus
I hope he‚Äôs talking to Jesus
For the rest of his life

There‚Äôs no wrong way to do it
There‚Äôs no bad time to start
It don't have to sound pretty
Just tell him what‚Äôs on your heart
Cause it‚Äôs not a religion
It‚Äôs more like a friendship
Just talk to your Father
Like you are his kid

Just start talking to Jesus
Just start talking to Jesus
You can talk to Jesus
Whenever you like

Just start talking to Jesus
Just start talking to Jesus
Just keep talking to Jesus
For the rest of your life

         <description>Why? I believe this is will be unnecessary when official Plugin API will come out. But people continue to ask so I‚Äôll put a HOW-TO here.   ‚ö† Warning ‚ö†  Running scripts could contain experimental features which can do something with your notes/vault/Obsidian. Be careful and make backups.  How to? For example, we have this code snippet:  alert(&quot;You just run a script&quot;)   Open Obsidian. Press Ctrl+Shift+I/Cmd+Shift+I.

&quot;Be Cool.&quot; - Pulp Fiction (1994) #shorts #pulpfiction #movie #quentintarantino

Pulp Fiction is a 1994 American crime film written and directed by Quentin Tarantino from a story he conceived with Roger Avary. It tells four intertwining tales of crime and violence in Los Angeles, California. The film stars John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, Tim Roth, Ving Rhames, and Uma Thurman. The title refers to the pulp magazines and hardboiled crime novels popular during the mid-20th century, known for their graphic violence and punchy dialogue.

         <title>Tom Bilyeu REVEALS His Ultimate SLEEP ROUTINE for High Performance</title>

Sleep is not only an essential function that allows us to recharge mentally and physically, it‚Äôs also deemed so important that going without sleep was banned by Guinness World Records. The record for going without sleep was officially given to Randy Gardner who managed to survive 11 days without sleep in 1964 while giving himself a form of dementia. Obviously this is not the path to take for increasing productivity and optimizing your quality of life, but many of us are short changing our sleep every night and have been doing so for years. Sleep is something that should be protected and guarded at all costs if you want to execute consistently at a high level and optimize for higher output and results. Here are Tom‚Äôs 10 tips to help you prioritize your sleep even if you‚Äôre burning the candle at both ends, there is no excuse and no way around prioritizing your sleep hygiene.
 
SHOW NOTES:
 
0:00 | Introduction to Sleep Routine

QUOTES:
 
‚ÄúThe second you wake up, get out, go outside and get that sun exposure‚Äù [1:26]
 
‚ÄúFor the last hour before bed, I'm doing fun things and doing things that give me energy that makes me feel light that are part of that passion that feel good.‚Äù [8:56]
 
‚ÄúI only have one job now that I'm going to bed and that job is to sleep.‚Äù [9:38]
 
‚ÄúMake sure that you don't have an alarm staring you in the face and that you get whatever amount of sleep you need.‚Äù [22:02]
 
‚ÄúRecognizing that you can shift your state and get into that much more pleasant place is really powerful. And to even do that, on your worst days, is incredibly beneficial.‚Äù [23:40]</description>

         <title>Ariana Grande Reveals Her Biggest Insecurity</title>
         <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAp_CpnkK4I</link>
         <description>Ariana Grande‚Äôs biggest insecurity involves her face and she just revealed why! Ariana always shows the right side of her face in photos and it‚Äôs for a specific reason. When Ariana went to Australia in 2014 for a photoshoot, her team told photographers to avoid using natural light and only take photos of her left side. But it gets even crazier, when Ariana was on the cover of Cosmopolitan in 2017, she posed with her left side also. Not one of Ariana‚Äôs photos in the magazine showed her face from the right side or the front. Nothing is wrong with the right side of Ariana‚Äôs face but she‚Äôs still very insecure about it and a New York photographer named Pamela Hanson revealed why, Pamela said faces aren‚Äôt symmetrical, and people who are photographed a lot know how they look best. She said left cheeks showed more emotion in photos and viewers found it more pleasing to the eye. So Ariana‚Äôs biggest insecurity is actually backed by science!</description>

         <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_c8myPJQlY</link>
         <description>We infiltrated a &quot;Save America&quot; rally in Des Moines, Iowa, where former President Donald Trump was slated to give a speech. 20-year-old journalist Adam Mockler interviewed some of Trump's biggest supporters and provided pushback when they went off the rails. We ask them about Ron DeSantis, voter fraud, and immigration, then uncovered some interesting insights into their views on the 'transgender hysteria' being pushed by mainstream Republicans lately.

Don't compare me to Jordan Klepper :/

Time is the enemy of the rich man, so the rich try to save time.

Your time is finite, a resource which can never be replaced.

         <title>Two Superpowers You Didn't Know You Had</title>
         <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx-QEpgRqpI</link>
         <description>Discover two fascinating and often overlooked superpowers that most people possess without even realizing it!

First, delve into the remarkable skill of distinguishing between the sound of hot and cold water being poured. This unique skill stems from our brain's ability to process subtle auditory cues. When water is heated or cooled, its viscosity changes, resulting in slight variations in the sound it produces as it flows. The human auditory system, through years of exposure and experience, becomes attuned to these distinctions. As a result, some individuals can accurately discern whether water is hot or cold solely based on the sound it makes.

The second superpower involves our remarkable facial recognition capabilities. Despite being exposed to countless faces in our daily lives, our brains possess an astonishing capacity to recognize and remember faces. Research suggests that even fleeting exposures to faces, as brief as a quarter of a second, can leave a lasting impression in our memory. This ability is attributed to a specialized region in our brain called the fusiform face area, which is responsible for processing and storing facial information. The intricate neural network involved in facial recognition allows us to recall whether we have encountered a face before, even after a rapid fire presentation of portraits.

         <title>My Mother Told Me - Viking Chant with @PeytonParrish and @sampopemusic #basssinger #acappella</title>
         <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qw-7Ih8-Vu4</link>
         <description>In this video, I'm singing My Mother Told Me with Viking Music Legend - @PeytonParrish and acapella singer @sampopemusic. This Viking chant is a great way to warm up and energize your vocal cords before a performance!

Whether you're a bass singer, vocalist, or just looking for a fun way to practice your vocals, this bass harmony song is sure to please. Get ready to feel the power of My Mother Told Me!

Vikings were known for being fierce warriors. They were also known for their sagas‚Äîepic stories passed orally from generation to generation. But what about their music? What sort of tunes did these Scandinavians jam out to in between plundering?

Viking music was pretty epic‚Äîjust like the sagas, they sang about. Most of what we know about Viking music comes from ancient Icelandic poems called Eddas, which were written in the 13th century. From these poems, we can infer that Viking music was likely throbbing and percussion-heavy, meant to get the blood pumping and ready for battle. 

We also know that Viking music wasn't just for entertainment; it was sacred in Norse culture and believed to have mystical powers. For example, it was thought that the right kind of music could summon supernatural beings like elves and dwarves. It's no wonder many of the instruments used in Viking music were crafted with great care and detail. 

The most common instrument was a type of harp called a lyre, which was often made with wood and bone and decorated with intricate carvings. Other popular instruments included flutes, lutes, drums, and horns. 

If you need a boost of courage or strength, look no further than Viking music! These ancient Scandinavians knew how to craft a tune (or two) that would get even the fiercest warrior pumped up for battle. So next time you need some motivation, give Viking music a listen‚Äîyou might find yourself singing along to an epic saga in no time. YEAHHH! üí™üèæ

         <description>Karate is a Japanese martial art that emphasizes powerful strikes and explosive movements. Karate training typically involves a combination of physical conditioning, technique practice, and sparring. Many karate schools also emphasize the development of mental discipline and focus, as well as respect for one's training partners and instructors.

One of the benefits of karate training is improved physical fitness. Karate training can help improve strength, flexibility, endurance, and balance. It can also help improve cardiovascular health and reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and obesity.

Another benefit of karate training is improved self-confidence. As students learn new techniques and improve their physical abilities, they often become more confident in their ability to defend themselves and handle difficult situations. This can translate into other areas of their lives, such as school or work, where they may feel more confident and assertive.

Karate training can also be a great way to relieve stress and improve mental health. The physical activity involved in karate can help reduce stress and anxiety, while the mental focus required for technique practice and sparring can help improve concentration and mindfulness. Many karate schools also emphasize the development of a strong mind-body connection, which can help students feel more centered and balanced.

In addition to the physical and mental benefits of karate training, many people also enjoy the social aspects of training. Karate schools often have a strong sense of community, with students supporting and encouraging each other in their training. Many schools also offer opportunities for students to compete in tournaments or other events, which can be a fun and rewarding experience.

Overall, karate is a challenging and rewarding martial art that offers many benefits for physical and mental health, as well as personal development. Whether you're interested in self-defense, physical fitness, or simply learning a new skill, karate is a great choice for anyone looking to improve themselves and their lives.</description>

         <title>How the Bible Mistranslates &quot;Heart&quot;</title>

         <description>It's time to challenge the English Bible's mistranslation of the Hebrew word &quot;levav.&quot; While &quot;heart&quot; is the commonly accepted translation, but in it's original cultural context, the word actually encompasses both emotions and rationality. That's right - our understanding of the Bible may have been skewed all this time! But fear not, this video is not all doom and gloom. It's an entertaining exploration of the intricacies of language and how words can have multiple meanings.  

For more info, there is a whole chapter dedicated to translating this word in the book &quot;And God Said...&quot; by Joel Hoffman.</description>

It's about taking care of the people you LOVE

At the end of the day, people will remember you not because of how much money you had

But because of how you made them FEEL

Lyrics:
Small kid in a small town 
Lived with his head down
Good luck never came his way
Tragic in the making 
A heart full of aching 
Those thoughts never went away

And when all you‚Äôve known is your own four walls and they get so close and it hurts cause you‚Äôre so afraid, so afraid

So he kept running ah  running ah running ah running away

Charlie Brown 
Hold tight we‚Äôre moving on
Keep that dream just a little bit longer 
Hold tight, we‚Äôre moving on, keep that dream just a little bit longer 

Charlie Brown 
Hold tight we‚Äôre moving on
Keep that dream just a little bit longer 
Hold tight, we‚Äôre moving on, keep that dream just a little bit longer 

Clean shave and a tie on 
He‚Äôs taking a ride on
A bus through town in a far off land 
Still stuck in the dirt 
There was nothing but hurt 
Too bad that clothes don‚Äôt make a man 
And you hold out hope 
That you might belong Charlie Brown

Charlie Brown 
Hold tight we‚Äôre moving on
Keep that dream just a little bit longer 
Hold tight, we‚Äôre moving on, keep that dream just a little bit longer 
Charlie Brown 
Hold tight we‚Äôre moving on
Keep that dream just a little bit longer 
Hold tight, we‚Äôre moving on, keep that dream just a little bit longer 

Hold tight, we‚Äôre moving on, keep that dream just a little bit longer..ohh
Hold tight, we‚Äôre moving on, keep that dream just a little bit longer..ohh

he kept running away...ohh

Lyrics:
Five nights on a dime 
Can‚Äôt pay the rent
Smoked skies 
And the smell of a cigarette
And he‚Äôs had some
Wants to let go 
She got high 
But he don‚Äôt know

She goes on and on and on and on again
But they came down

I wanna lose my mind with you 
I wanna kill my time with you
I wanna waste my life wasting yours too. 

I wanna lose my mind with you 
I wanna kill my time with you
I wanna waste my life wasting yours too. 

Long nights 
In a dive bar 
Heaven spent
You don‚Äôt drink 
But your eyes 
Say everything
And I feel like I wanna dance now
But it seems like you wanna bow out

We go on and on and on and on again
But you came down

I wanna lose my mind with you 
I wanna kill my time with you
I wanna waste my life wasting yours too. 

I wanna lose my mind with you 
I wanna kill my time with you
I wanna waste my life wasting yours too. 

I wanna lose my
I wanna kill my
I wanna waste my
I wanna waste my

I wanna lose my mind with you 
I wanna kill my time with you
I wanna waste my life wasting yours too.

         <title>The Craziest Philosopher in History #stoicism</title>
         <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-SPCiwSvLo</link>
         <description>When the craziest philosopher in history was caught masturbating in public, he said he wished it were as easy to get rid of hunger by touching his belly. When a man called him a dog, he urinated on the man's leg. When the man got angry, he said, 'If I'm a dog, why are you surprised?' When he was sentenced to exile by the people of Sinope, he said, 'And I condemn you to remain in this city.' When he was sold as a slave and the auctioneer asked what kind of work he was good for, he replied, 'To be a master.' When Plato defined humans as the only featherless bipeds, he entered his lecture with a plucked chicken and said, 'Behold, a man!' When he saw the son of an unwed mother throwing stones at the crowd, he approached him and said, 'Be careful, boy. You might hit your father.'

üìú Story: 
In this fascinating video, we dive into the incredible world of Turkish hot sand coffee. Here, coffee appears to materialize out of the desert itself, but this seemingly magical phenomenon is all a matter of simple physics at work. We explore the unique heat-conducting properties of sand and how a metal pot, when embedded into the hot sand, begins to heat up from its base. The continuous supply of heat eventually causes the water inside the pot to evaporate, initiating the boiling process. This in turn, pushes the frothy coffee to ascend within the pot, creating a captivating visual spectacle that is sure to capture your imagination. Join us as we unravel the mysteries of this traditional Turkish coffee-making technique, shedding light on the science behind this enchanting coffee experience.

         <title>4 Ways English Bibles Change Eve</title>
         <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIXKQb1E22s</link>
         <description>In the Bible, the story of Eve in Genesis 2-3 undergoes some interesting changes when translated into English. These changes can impact our understanding of Eve's role and the consequences she faces. Let's explore four key translations that alter the original story.

Firstly, the translation of Eve being created from Adam's &quot;rib&quot; is widely known. However, in ancient Hebrew texts, the word used is closer to &quot;side,&quot; suggesting a more equal and interconnected partnership between Adam and Eve.

Secondly, the term &quot;helper&quot; is often used to describe Eve's role. However, the original Hebrew word implies a more significant meaning of &quot;rescuer&quot; or &quot;partner,&quot; highlighting a deeper sense of support and collaboration.

Thirdly, there is a difference in translations regarding Eve's desire towards her husband. Some versions say her desire will be &quot;for&quot; her husband, while others say it will be &quot;contrary to&quot; him. This distinction affects our interpretation of the power dynamics and relationship dynamics between men and women.</description>

         <title>Mysterious Ancient Collage Language</title>
         <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl7_7PPQvq8</link>
         <description>The Scythians, a nomadic people of ancient Eurasia, employed a fascinating method of communication through physical objects. One notable example is when they sent a box of items to King Darius I of Persia as a message.

Meanwhile, the Inca Empire, known for its advanced civilization in ancient South America, employed a unique form of visual communication known as the knot tying language, called &quot;quipu.&quot; Quipus were intricate systems of knotted strings made from various fibers, colors, and knot types. These elaborate arrangements of knots represented a sophisticated method of recording and conveying information. Different knot positions, colors, and spacing conveyed numerical data, calendar events, historical accounts, and even storytelling. Quipus served as memory aids for record-keeping and played a crucial role in administrative tasks, taxation, and historical documentation within the Inca Empire. Although the exact interpretation of quipus remains a subject of ongoing study, they stand as a remarkable testament to the visual communication prowess of the Inca civilization.

The development and widespread adoption of the alphabet brought about significant changes in communication practices, ultimately leading to the decline and eradication of various ancient visual communication methods.</description>

         <title>The Craft of Quill Pens</title>
         <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pFGyxxY260</link>
         <description>When the reed pen died out, the quill pen was invented around the 6th century in Seville, Spain.

Writing with a quill pen is a fascinating art that requires more than just plucking a feather and dipping it in ink. The process is intricate and demands careful attention to detail. First and foremost, selecting the appropriate feather is crucial. Different birds yield feathers with varying qualities, such as flexibility and durability. For instance, swan feathers are often preferred due to their strong and flexible nature.

Preparing the feather for writing is a meticulous task. The feather needs to be cleaned, trimmed, and boiled to remove any residual oils and make it more pliable. After boiling, it is dried in hot sand to maintain its shape and prevent it from curling or splitting during use.

One of the most intricate steps involves carving the nib, which determines the thickness and flow of the ink. The nib's tip needs to be delicately shaped and slit to ensure smooth ink flow and precise strokes. It demands skilled craftsmanship and practice to master this art.

In conclusion, writing with a quill pen involves a comprehensive process beyond the initial perception. From selecting the right feather to meticulously preparing it and carving the nib, this ancient practice demands a deep understanding of materials and craftsmanship. It is a testament to the patience and skill required to produce beautiful, intricate script with such a traditional writing instrument.</description>

This video explores the myriad benefits of running and what running does to the body. Running is an extremely functional movement that can transform your fitness and restore more optimal movement. 

There's a tendency to think of running as only a way to lose weight, or to get better AT running. However, there are countless more benefits of running. 

For starters, running in a steady state manner means countless repetitions of movement. This is exactly the antedote to a life of sitting. Running is also great for the bones, circulation, and brain.

Watch the video to learn precisely how running changes the body - even if you only run once a week!

         <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5beZvo949WA</link>
         <description>Media mutes name of Jesus üò≥

We shouldn't be surprised, though. They tried to cancel Him 2,000 years ago (didn't work).

Love Him or hate Him, you can't deny - there's no name on planet earth that's more of a lightning rod than the name of Jesus.

And the Bible's promise is clear. Though His message might be muted momentarily, a day is coming when every knee will bow and every tongue will confess that He is Lord.

         <title>The Art of Nuclear Waste Warnings</title>
         <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBAfwlp1To4</link>
         <description>Nuclear semiotics is an interdisciplinary field that combines elements of linguistics, semiotics, archaeology, and other disciplines to explore the problem of long-term communication regarding nuclear waste repositories. It focuses on developing methods and systems to effectively communicate the dangers associated with nuclear waste to future generations or civilizations thousands of years into the future.

The primary goal of nuclear semiotics is to create a communication system that can convey information about the presence of buried nuclear waste and its potential hazards, even in the absence of a shared language or cultural context. The challenge arises from the fact that languages and cultural symbols can change over time, and the current understanding of the messages we use may not persist for thousands of years.

Researchers in nuclear semiotics have proposed various approaches to address this issue. Some ideas include the use of pictograms, symbols, and physical markers that can convey warnings or instructions across time. The design of such symbols often takes into account factors like universal recognition, stability, and resistance to alteration.

Additionally, nuclear semiotics also involves considering the development of oral traditions, myths, and legends that can be passed down through generations as a means of preserving knowledge about nuclear waste repositories. These narratives can serve as cultural markers that signal the presence of danger.

The field of nuclear semiotics acknowledges the challenge of creating a communication system that can withstand the test of time, and it emphasizes the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration to find viable solutions for long-term nuclear waste management and safety.</description>

         <title>The Strongest Weapon In Marvel</title>
         <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIfoe4V9I1M</link>
         <description>The all-black necro sword in Marvel is undoubtedly one of the most formidable weapons ever known. Originally crafted by null, an Eldritch God of darkness and the creator of all symbiotes, this weapon possesses incredible might. It forms a profound bond with its wielder, exerting a malevolent influence on their personality while granting immense power. The necro sword's might was demonstrated when it was used to sever the head of a celestial, binding the sword to the undead body of this cosmic being and amplifying its potency even further.

         <description>How often do you hang? ü¶• Hanging from a bar is becoming more popular because it works. It helps release stiff back and shoulder muscles and improves the connection from your hand to your spine. 

But another worthy form of hanging is the horizontal hang. This variation puts more stretch on your lat muscles and even helps you stretch the side of your torso, targeting those tricky-to-release muscles like the QL, obliques, and intercostals. Plus you don‚Äôt need a bar or anything overhead, just a sturdy object at hip height to hold onto. 

Next time you wake up with a stiff back or need to stretch out your spine after hunching over a computer, give the horizontal hang a try. Let us know how it goes in the comments below. #shorts #youtubeshorts

         <description>THE GOD EQUATION. Michio Kaku
What if there was a single equation that could unlock the secrets of the universe? This is the bold claim made by physicist Michio Kaku. In his latest book, The God Equation, Kaku explores the possibility of a formula that could help us understand the fundamental nature of the universe and solve some of the biggest mysteries of physics. From the nature of dark matter and dark energy to the existence of multiple universes beyond our own, the God equation could potentially revolutionize our understanding of the cosmos.

         <title>English Bibles Whitewash This Guy</title>
         <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ocoi0WZu_Bk</link>
         <description>In this video, we explore how the character of Esau is whitewashed in English translations of the Bible. In Genesis, when Esau asks his brother Jacob for food, he speaks in a gruff and aggressive manner, using language that is considered vulgar in Hebrew. However, English translations soften his words to make him sound more polite and refined. This revision reflects a cultural bias towards an arbitrary standard of decorum and a desire to present biblical characters in a certain way. By examining this linguistic shift, we can gain a deeper understanding of how translation shapes our perception of the Bible and its characters.</description>

=============================
I love to paint miniatures of all various things from the likes of Games workshop, be it Warhammer 40000, Warhammer Fantasy, Horus Heresy, Age of Sigmar to their smaller games like Kill Team, Warcry or Warhammer Underworlds. I‚Äôve always been a big of a fan of Space Marines -- especially the Blood Angels, the first ever army I had from 3rd edition (super looking forward to Warhammer 40K 10th edition!). At some point I‚Äôm hoping to pick up the reins and get back in miniature wargaming hopefully this new edition. Also on occasion I‚Äôll even paint up Dungeons &amp; Dragons minis but one thing I‚Äôve been really loving painting is Kingdom Death Monster. Just great and interesting miniatures especially the monsters. Hopefully you‚Äôll find that we make great painting for beginners videos plus engaging content in the general hobby related space. If any of these things interest you then you‚Äôve come to the right place!</description>

         <description>Did you know that Napoleon's wife had a friend who was referred to as government property because of her many relationships with ministers of state? Or that Oddly enough, Machiavelli wrote a letter to his friend describing his experience of sleeping with a woman, only to throw up all over her when the lights came on because of her ugliness? And let's not forget about Julie d'Aubigny- a famous 17th-century swordswoman and opera singer!

         <title>Vishnu and The Sudarshan Chakra: Devotion That Won Lord's Heart #hindu #shorts #vishnu #shiva</title>
         <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2WIMTPdcXE</link>
         <description>All the gods turned to Lord Vishnu for help against the Rakhshasas but he was unable to fight them alone and sought Lord Shiva's assistance. However, he found Shiva in a deep trance and decided to pray for him until he came out of it. Vishnu offered a thousand lotus flowers every day while chanting Shiva's name for years until Shiva finally emerged. Unaware of Shiva's awakening, Vishnu continued his chanting and realized one flower was missing , as Shiva decides to play a trick on Vishnu, and secretly removes one lotus from the bunch that Vishnu had arranged. To show his devotion, Vishnu offered his eye, and impressed by his dedication, Shiva granted him a boon. Vishnu asked for the power to defeat the rakhshasas and Shiva gave him the Sudarshana Chakra, a disc capable of destroying anything.</description>

         <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e61hm9gJjNQ</link>
         <description>Eddie Penney joins us on the Shawn Ryan Show to give you his firsthand account of once being scared of Jesus, what he referred to as the boogeyman, to becoming a true warrior of Christ. Eddie served as a United States Marine to later becoming a U.S. Navy SEAL and joining the Elite SEAL Team 6. Eddie  has seen the worst of evil and even became addicted to taking the evil off this planet. A chapter in his new book, Unafraid, titled &quot;kill addict&quot; describes his desires of taking the fight to the enemy. Eddie has weathered the storm and has faced many challenges along his journey while serving at DEVGRU. One of the biggest loss that occurred from his Squadron at Gold was Extortion 17. This is a true story of a man who surrendered his life to God after a life at war.

         <description>You wouldn't believe the amount of brilliance that Chris Beck, formerly Kristin Beck, possesses. Troubled by his traumatic childhood, Chris found pleasure in other areas that we often, as humans, judge without fully understanding the why behind it. He stated, &quot;I want to be my sister because I don't want to be me. It's not because I want to be my sister or I want to be a female, I just don't want to be me.&quot; In SRS EP. 050, we unpack EVERYTHING that Chris has kept a secret.

         <description>SECRET AT THE END!! To Smelt Your Metals like us Contact: Vadim &amp; Co. 36 West 47th St., (Booth 25), New York, NY 10036

I had $120,000 cash, and I'm gonna show you how I turn this cash into $150,000 of gold. We gathered all of our gold and diamond dust, scraps, and extra clippings to melt another one of the world's largest gold bars. This one turned out to be 3,800 pennyweights, which is 7.5 KILOS of gold. Now it was time to stash, if you can guess the combination the stash is yours.

         <title>SEAL Team 6 Operators Thoughts on American Sniper #shorts</title>
         <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNI7h9gUJCk</link>
         <description>Eddie Penney joins us on the Shawn Ryan Show to give you his firsthand account of once being scared of Jesus, what he referred to as the boogeyman, to becoming a true warrior of Christ. Eddie served as a United States Marine to later becoming a U.S. Navy SEAL and joining the Elite SEAL Team 6. Eddie  has seen the worst of evil and even became addicted to taking the evil off this planet. A chapter in his new book, Unafraid, titled &quot;kill addict&quot; describes his desires of taking the fight to the enemy. Eddie has weathered the storm and has faced many challenges along his journey while serving at DEVGRU. One of the biggest loss that occurred from his Squadron at Gold was Extortion 17. This is a true story of a man who surrendered his life to God after a life at war.

         <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kxrlzs8YFs</link>
         <description>Russia and Ukraine have been involved in armed conflict since the beginning of 2014. Russia escalated their efforts of a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in early 2022. The Biden administration has directed more than $75 billion in aid to Ukraine, including humanitarian, financial, security assistance, weapons and equipment, grants, and loans for weapons and equipment. The big question that is often heard amongst Americans is why? Why are we there? Why are we sending so much aid when we can't wrestle our way out of trillions of dollars in debt and the countless other problems America is facing? And then what is next? Is this going to escalate to a nuclear war? Could this turn into World War III? When will it end?

         <description>Did you know that the Babylonians used a base-60 system to tell time and calculate angles, and that we still use this system today in our measurement of time (60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour)? In the Bible,  the ancient Israelites, like many other ancient cultures, used a base-12 system to count and measure things.</description>

Marvel's Spider-Man[a] is a 2018 action-adventure game developed by Insomniac Games and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment. Based on the Marvel Comics character Spider-Man, it tells an original narrative that is inspired by the long-running comic book mythology, while also drawing from various adaptations in other media. In the main story, the super-human crime lord Mister Negative orchestrates a plot to seize control of New York City's criminal underworld. When Mister Negative threatens to release a deadly virus, Spider-Man must confront him and protect the city while dealing with the personal problems of his civilian persona, Peter Parker.

Gameplay is presented from the third-person perspective with a primary focus on Spider-Man's traversal and combat abilities. Spider-Man can freely move around New York City, interacting with characters, undertaking missions, and unlocking new gadgets and suits by progressing through the main story or completing tasks. Outside the story, the player is able to complete side missions to unlock additional content and collectible items. Combat focuses on chaining attacks together and using the environment and webs to incapacitate numerous foes while avoiding damage.

         <title>The Mystery of &quot;Gopher&quot; Wood in the Bible</title>
         <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8fDYI8Cyg</link>
         <description>In the Bible, the term &quot;gopher&quot; wood is mentioned only once, in the story of Noah's Ark. Despite its prominent role, the meaning of this term remains a mystery to scholars and theologians. Some theories suggest it could refer to a type of cypress or cedar wood, while others propose it might be a specific method of wood preparation.

         <description>Did you know that Tycho Brahe, the famous Danish astronomer, famously lost his nose in a sword duel with his cousin over a mathematical computation? To cover up his disfigurement, he wore a prosthetic nose made of silver and gold and even filled it with herbs to mask the stench. Oh, and Mozart exchanged some weird, flirtatious letters too!

         <title>Crazy Facts About Historical Figures #shorts #history</title>
         <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwHgvXybSwg</link>
         <description>We've all heard some wild stories, but this one might take the cake. Aeschylus, the ancient Greek playwright, died when an eagle dropped a tortoise on his bald head mistaking it for a stone. And Lord Byron, the romantic poet, was famously angered when a portrait of him was painted without his beloved pet bear. Crazy facts about historical figures indeed!

         <title>Mark Wahlberg 40 lbs of muscle in 7 weeks</title>
         <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpOSyXxpt8s</link>
         <description>In 2013, Mark Wahlberg gained 40 lbs of muscle in 7 weeks in preparation for filming Pain &amp; Gain, where he played the role of criminal bodybuilder Daniel Lugo.

In his previous movie (Broken City) he had to slim down to 165 lbs, but needed to be 205 lbs to play the role of Lugo.

Mark claims this was achieved with heavy weight training and lots of calories, including 2-3 mass gainer shakes per day.

         <description>You wouldn't believe the amount of brilliance that Chris Beck, formerly Kristin Beck, possesses. Troubled by his traumatic childhood, Chris found pleasure in other areas that we often, as humans, judge without fully understanding the why behind it. He stated, &quot;I want to be my sister because I don't want to be me. It's not because I want to be my sister or I want to be a female, I just don't want to be me.&quot; In SRS EP. 050, we unpack EVERYTHING that Chris has kept a secret.

         <title>Bible Scrubbing: The Problematic Editing of Rebekah's Voice</title>
         <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSbaQWSAeZA</link>
         <description>Have you ever noticed how Bible translations can sometimes scrub over the voices of the characters? In this video, we take a closer look at the story of Rebekah, specifically the moment when she is pregnant with twins and cries out in pain. While the original text presents her as fragmented and struggling to speak, many English translations clean up her language to make it sound like she's calm and collected. Why is this the case, and what does it say about the way we approach the Bible? Join us as we explore the implications of this editing and the importance of recognizing the full range of voices in Scripture.</description>

         <title>How Adam's &quot;Rib&quot; is Mistranslated</title>
         <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FN4pVp6lNJ0</link>
         <description>You may have heard that in the Bible Eve was created from Adam's &quot;rib.&quot;  As it turns out, the translation of the word &quot;rib&quot; from Hebrew to English may have been a little... off.   In the Hebrew text of the Bible, the word used to describe the body part taken from Adam to create Eve is &quot;tsela.&quot; While this word can be translated as &quot;rib,&quot; it more accurately means &quot;side&quot; or &quot;part of the body.&quot; This is supported by the fact that in all other instances where &quot;tsela&quot; appears in the Bible, it refers to a side or a part of something, rather than a literal rib. So, it's possible that the word was mistranslated due to cultural biases or assumptions about gender roles in early translations of the Bible</description>

         <title>When Hephaestus Tried To Sleep With Athena! | Mythical Madness</title>
         <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZWQAVXW1iU</link>
         <description>In this video, we'll tell the story of Hephaestus, the god of fire, and his attempt to sleep with Athena, the goddess of wisdom and war.

Hephaestus was famously lonesome, and so he tried to seduce Athena in order to fill that inner emptiness. But Athena was wise enough to see through Hephaestus's disguise and reject him. Watch the video to know the result of Hephaestus forcing Athena!

         <title>Be A Thinker Not A Follower | Codie Sanchez</title>
         <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY1JB5H5x-o</link>
         <description>Codie Sanchez owns a portfolio of dozens of &quot;boring businesses&quot; that bring in more than $50 million in annual revenue. She also founded Contrarian Thinking, a financial media company with 100 million views per month.

Codie's journey began as a journalist covering stories along the US-Mexico border, before she transitioned to a career in finance and private equity investing.

In this segment, she emphasizes her motto about questioning everything you are told and determining if it stands true to you, as a means of shielding yourself from making bad decisions (including bad investment decisions).

         <title>This is perhaps my favorite password manager for the terminal</title>
         <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhwsfH2TpFA</link>
         <description>Password managers are a prime target for exploitation given their high reward. For me, I prefer to use self custody to manage my passwords, which gives me control over my own data. Because of this, I use password-store which a unix based password management solution. Password store is perfect for my use case, and allows me to easily manage my passwords on the cli.

In this video, I give an introduction to password store, and talk about how to get set up and working with it. From inserting and generating passwords, to then having access to them in your browser and developer workflow, all whilst keeping your passwords secure and under your control.

         <title>Neighbor gets SO MAD when I tell him to stop...</title>
         <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiOKkjwyL80</link>
         <description>I repaired a damaged area on a vacant lot for a new property owner. The neighbor who continued to dump on the same spot after the repair couldn't understand why he had to move his pile two feet because he has been dumping it in the same place for 19 years...

Obviously this is an edited version of the encounter, the full confrontation will be in an upcoming video that highlighted the dirt work and repair efforts that went into the lot (and the follow up).

His real name is Patrick &quot;Eel&quot; O'Brian, and he gained his powers after being exposed to a chemical that gave him the ability to stretch and shape his body into any form.

Plastic Man is known for his sense of humor and his ability to use his stretchy powers in creative ways.</description>

         <title>Understand Abstract Syntax Trees - ASTs - in Practical and Useful Ways for Frontend Developers</title>
         <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tM_S-pa4xDk</link>
         <description>Master abstract syntax trees, ASTs, with Wealthfront Engineer, Spencer Miskoviak.  Spencer shares his understanding of ASTs, acquired throughout his career at Wealthfront and previously Handshake and Target, to help up-level your ability to maintain continuously evolving large JavaScript codebases, to parse, traverse, and generate abstract syntax trees and much more.  Get started with abstract syntax tree fundamentals and dive deep into several practical use cases of abstract syntax trees in the full course, Practical Abstract Syntax Trees, here: https://ift.tt/fmPYQwg.
 
As a frontend engineer, it can be difficult to appreciate ASTs because you likely don't use traditional compilers outputting bytecode as such. It is likely that you rely on tooling built on top of abstract syntax trees. Some common examples of frontend build tools or compilers that rely on abstract syntax trees are webpack, babel, and swc. However, ASTs aren't isolated to build tools either. Tools like Prettier (code formatter), ESLint (code linter), or jscodeshift (code transformer) have different purposes but they all rely on abstract syntax trees.  It's not necessary to understand abstract syntax trees to be a productive and successful frontend engineer.

Lyrics:

love and hate get it wrong
she cut me right back down to size
sleep the day let it fade
who was there to take your place
no one knows never will
mostly me but mostly you
what do you say do you do
when it all comes down

cause I don't want to come back down from this cloud
it's taken me all this time to find out what I need yeah
I don't want to come back down from this cloud
taken me all this time to find out what I need</description>

         <title>How to use ChatGPT to easily learn any skill you want</title>
         <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnDudvCyWpc</link>
         <description>In today's video, I show you how I've been using AI to help me learn any skill or subject that I want. I've been attempting to self-educate myself for years and haven't really been successful, but ever since getting my hands on tools like ChatGPT, self-teaching myself has honestly been easier than ever. I hope some of the methods I mention in the video can help you learn more easily too :)

Flagrant is a comedy show that delivers unfiltered, unapologetic, and unruly hot takes directly to your dome piece. In an era dictated by political correctness, hosts Andrew Schulz and Akaash Singh, along with AlexxMedia and Mark Gagnon, could care less about sensitivities. If it‚Äôs funny and flagrant it flies. If you are sensitive this podcast is not for you. But if you miss the days of comedians actually being funny instead of preaching to a choir then welcome to The Flagrancy.

Yeonmi Park is a North Korean defector and activist whose family fled from North Korea to China in 2007 and settled in South Korea in 2009, before moving to the United States in 2014. Her family turned to black-market trading during the North Korean famine in the 1990s. Her father was sent to a labor camp for smuggling. They fled to China, where Park and her mother fell into the hands of human traffickers and she was sold into slavery before escaping to Mongolia. She is now an advocate for victims of human trafficking in China and works to promote human rights in North Korea and around the globe.</description>

         <title>Uber Attorney vs Corrupt Cop: The Ultimate Showdown on the Road</title>
         <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxCXP9dfhX8</link>
         <description>AO

Imagine this. You're an attorney, and you've just finished a long day at work. But instead of heading straight home, you decide to pick up some extra cash by driving for Uber. You're in the middle of a ride when suddenly, the police pull you over. And it's not because of anything you did wrong.

It's because of your passenger. They fit a certain profile, and the police are convinced that they're up to no good.

That's exactly what happened to this attorney. But what happened next was even more shocking.


When the police officers saw his bar card, they knew they were in trouble. They had tried to intimidate an attorney into submission, and it wasn't going to work.

Uber driver attorney stood up for himself, and he made it clear that he wasn't going to be bullied. He knew his rights, and he wasn't afraid to assert them.

This is a powerful reminder that you have the right to stand up for yourself no matter who you are. 

Whether you're an attorney or not, you have the right to be treated fairly and with respect. And if someone tries to intimidate you, don't be afraid to stand up to them.

This Uber driver s proof that the justice system can work, and that we all have the power to make a difference.

Eric Weinstein is an American mathematician, economist, and podcaster. He is the managing director of Thiel Capital, a venture capital firm founded by Peter Thiel, and is also known for his contributions to the development of gauge theory and his work on geometric unity. Weinstein is a popular figure in intellectual circles and has been a guest on several podcasts and shows, where he has discussed topics ranging from economics and politics to science and technology. He is also the host of &quot;The Portal,&quot; a podcast where he interviews guests from various fields and explores topics related to intellectual curiosity and cultural evolution.

Written By ChatGPT: &quot;String theory is a theoretical framework that tries to reconcile two major but incompatible theories of physics, general relativity and quantum mechanics. It proposes that the fundamental building blocks of the universe are not point-like particles but one-dimensional objects called strings, which can vibrate at different frequencies to produce particles with different properties. In string theory, there are many possible ways that the strings can vibrate, giving rise to a large number of possible universes (or &quot;string vacua&quot;). One of the most interesting aspects of string theory is that it predicts the existence of extra dimensions of space beyond the familiar three dimensions of length, width, and height. While string theory remains highly speculative and has yet to make any definitive experimental predictions, it continues to be a subject of active research among theoretical physicists.&quot;

         <title>The IMPOTENT rifle gadget #krummlauf #shorts</title>
         <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9qb0Im_X70</link>
         <description>#shorts    #krummlauf    #curvedbarrel    

If you have a curved barrel like this, that‚Äôs just wrong. But if it is beginning to look like this one, then go see a doctor! 
Now if you focus: we are talking about Krummlauf (Curved Barrel). It is an odd-looking rifle attachment designed in 1943 by the Nazi Germany. It was intended to allow offensive soldiers shoot enemy infantry from the safety of the inside of this Elafant. But then, Germans realized how great it was for urban combat because now you can mysteriously shoot from around the corner without getting exposed.
Krummlauf was designed in various angles from 30 to 90 degrees, and some even had a periscope mount so you could aim it accurately.
But this bad boy would only last for a few hundred rounds because the curvature put immense stress on the barrel. The bullet itself would be shattered into fragments, but that‚Äôs even better because now you effectively own a shotgun for private-range combat. 

Are you still focusing?

         <title>Dave Chappelle on The Shocking Truth about Manhattan's Dark Past #viral #newyork</title>
         <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=th8a-iMHpFw</link>
         <description>In this interview clip, Dave Chappelle shares a mind-blowing story about the dark history of the native American tribe that sold the island of Manhattan to the Dutch for a mere $24 in 1626. Chappelle argues that the tribe was exploited because they were not aware of the true value of their land. The conversation with Conan O'Brien sheds light on the exploitation of native Americans and raises important questions about the power dynamics of history.

         <description>#boruto #naruto #hokage #sagemode #rinnegan #narutoshippuden 

Naruto's six paths sage mode is what many consider to be the strongest power at his disposal and rightfully so, but a lot of people seem to believe Naruto never used six paths sage mode in boruto, but the truth is that he's actually used it quite a bit, despite not using the truth seeking orbs, which a lot of people incorrectly use as the identifier for this power.

Lyrics:
Tata, tada, tata, tada
Tata, tada, tata, tada
Tata, tada, tata, tada
Tata, tada, tata, tada
Tata, tada, tata, tada
Tata, tada, tata, tada
Tata, tada, tata, tada
Tata, tada, tata, tada
Tata, tada, tata, tada
Tata, tada, tata, tada
Tata, tada, tata, tada
Tata, tada, tata, tada
I am sitting
In the morning
At the diner
On the corner
I am waiting
At the counter
For the man
To pour the coffee
And he fills it
Only halfway
And before
I even argue
He is looking
Out the window
At somebody
Coming in
Tata, tada, tata, tada
Tata, tada, tata, tada
Tata, tada, tata, tada
Tata, tada, tata, tada
Tata, tada, tata, tada
Tata, tada, tata, tada
Tata, tada, tata, tada
Tata, tada, tata, tada
Tata, tada, tata, tada
Tata, tada, tata, tada
Tata, tada, tata, tada
Tata, tada, tata, tada
&quot;It is always
Nice to see you&quot;
Says the man
Behind the counter
To the woman
Who has come in
She is shaking
Her umbrella
And I look
The other way
As they are kissing
Their hello's
And I'm pretending
Not to see them
And instead
I pour the milk
Tata, tada, tata, tada
Tata, tada, tata, tada
Tata, tada, tata, tada
Tata, tada, tata, tada
Tata, tada, tata, tada
Tata, tada, tata, tada
Tata, tada, tata, tada
Tata, tada, tata, tada
Oh no,
&quot;It is always nice to see you&quot;
&quot;It is always nice to see you&quot;
&quot;It is always nice to see you&quot;
&quot;It is always nice to see you&quot;
It is all, all, always nice to see you
Always, always nice, always nice to see you
Always nice to see you
It is all, all, always nice
Oh it is al, all always nice
Tata, tada, tata, tada
Tata, tada, tata, tada
Tata, tada, tata, tada
Tata, tada, tata, tada
Tata, tada, tata, tada
Tata, tada, tata, tada
Tata, tada, tata, tada
Tata, tada, tata, tada
Tata, tada, tata, tada
Tata, tada, tata, tada
Oh, &quot;It is always nice to see you&quot;
&quot;Always nice&quot;
&quot;It is always nice to see you&quot;
Tata, tada, tata, tada
Tata, tada, tata, tada
Tata, tada, tata, tada
Tata, tada, tata, tada
Tata, tada, tata, tada (Oh it is always nice to see you)
Tata, tada, tata, tada
Tata, tada, tata, tada (Always nice to see you)
Tata, tada, tata, tada
Tata, tada, tata, tada
Tata, tada, tata, tada
Tata, tada, tata, tada
Tata, tada, tata, tada
(Tata, tada, tata, tada)
(Tata, tada, tata, tada)

         <title>You want a real DNS Server at home? (bind9 docker)</title>
         <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syzwLwE3Xq4</link>
         <description>In this Tutorial, we set up a free and open-source DNS server for your home labs. We will deploy bind9 on an Ubuntu Linux server running Docker and configure it to be an authoritative DNS server in my local network. And we also configure forwarders and access control lists to protect our internal networks. #homeserver #dns #docker

Lyrics:
Locked up and I'm so in my head
Heart starts racing and I can't slow it down
Hands shaking and l'm losing my breath
Paralyzed with a mind spinning out
My strength has grown weak
No words left to speak
I fall to my knees
Cause I know what I need
 
You are the light when my world goes dark
You hold me together when I'm torn apart
And when my thoughts have run way too far
You're the calm for my anxious heart (oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh)
You're the calm for my anxious heart (oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh)
You're the calm for my anxious heart
 
Wrapped up in the arms of Your Love
Stilled by the silence above all the noise
Burden's light when You're lifting it up
Fear is terrified by the sound of Your voice
Cause You don't grow weak
Your word is peace
I fall to my knees
Cause I know what I need
 
You are the light when my world goes dark
You hold me together when I'm torn apart
And when my thoughts have run way too far
You're the calm for my anxious heart (oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh)
You're the calm for my anxious heart (oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh)
 
You know everything about me
You come and surround me
And everything that holds my soul
Falling in surrender
Learning to remember
You're the One who's in control
 
You're the light when my world goes dark
You hold me together when I'm torn apart
And when my thoughts have run way too far
You're the calm for my anxious heart
You're the life when my breath is gone
You're the hope when I'm stuck in the storm
And I know this is still who You are
 
You're the calm for my anxious heart (Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh)
You're the calm for my anxious heart (Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh)
You're the calm for my anxious heart

The report entitled Analysis and Assessment of The Gateway Process was penned in 1983 by US Army Lieutenant Colonel Wayne M McDonnell.
McDonnell described the Gateway Experience as 'a training system designed to bring enhanced strength, focus, and coherence to the amplitude and frequency of brainwave output between left and right hemispheres so as to alter consciousness, moving it outside the physical sphere so as to ultimately escape even the restrictions of time and space'.
In simpler terms, the Gateway Experience uses sound to manipulate brainwaves with the goal of creating an altered state of consciousness in which a person can interact with nonphysical aspects of reality.
Practical uses of the technique, according to the CIA report, include manifesting goals, converting energy to heal one's body, and even traveling across space and time to access new information.

         <title>How to code on your iPad with VS Code for free [Beginners guide]</title>
         <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=zlhfnEiNn1o&amp;feature=share</link>
         <description>#iPad #vscode #synology #coding 
Many of you asked me to show how to use Servediter for free and to be able to access the VS code from an iPad. So I‚Äôve prepared a few useful ways to go: the native solution, the local solution and the global solution. This is just a beginners guide but it will give you the direction of what you should do next.

         <title>3,760 Hours To Change Your Life</title>
         <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=KikgR_SYkqY&amp;feature=share</link>
         <description>Get 10% off your first month of therapy with our sponsor BetterHelp: https://betterhelp.com/LiamPorritt

A year kinda seems like a long time. But soon enough we‚Äôll be in 2024 and wondering wtf we did last year!? So, this video is about making sure that, when you answer that question, you can say - ‚ÄúI changed my fricking life for the better‚Äù üëå

How can you make sure 2023 is your best year yet?! Well, to me, it all starts with reflecting on where you want to get to by the end of the year. And then setting a small number of goals that allow us to focus each day on moving towards that ideal picture of ourselves at the end of the year üìà

Because here‚Äôs the thing - it‚Äôs way too easy to get on with our daily lives, doing the best we can at each of the little tasks that we face, without realising that all these tasks were leading in the wrong fluffing direction. We did s*1t well - but we did the wrong s*1t. 

So, this video is about making sure you do the right s*1t all year long, and end up looking back thinking - hell yeh, I bossed that, and am right where I want to be üòÉ 

There will, without doubt, be parts that you get hugely wrong, that go completely tits up, that you regret and that you wish had gone differently. It won‚Äôt be perfect. But, by having clear focuses for the next 8760 hours, you‚Äôll definitely finish the year closer to where you want to be than where you‚Äôre starting it.

About Me

I'm a lawyer, part-time YouTuber, son, brother, startup founder, fianc√©, black coffee drinker and plant dad.

Around that, I'm a big fan of discovering new ways of thinking, of balancing work with life, and of performing to the very best of my ability. Ohh, and being happy. And I try to share all that on this YouTube channel üòÄ

         <title>4 ONE-MINUTE Habits That Save Me 20+ Hours a Week - Time Management For ...</title>
         <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=R5i8alK5hPo&amp;feature=share</link>
         <description>The first 100 people to download Endel will get a free week of audio experiences - https://app.adjust.com/b8wxub6?campaign=liamporritt_January2023&amp;adgroup=youtube

In our busy lives, a few hours a week means time for a date, or a few hours of self-love pruning in the bath - so imagine what you could do with 10, 20 or even more extra time each week ü§Ø 

Well, from reading some of the best time management books out there, these are my top 4 quick habits to efficiently manage your time, which save me hours each week üôå They are simple, but hugely effective techniques to make the most of our 16 or so waking hours a day, and honestly are some of the core techniques that allow me to keep up a demanding career as a corporate lawyer, while running multiple businesses on the side üë®‚Äçüíª

The key to these habits is (as with all habits) consistency‚Ä¶ kinda obvious, I know. But with these habits especially, they really don‚Äôt take much effort, but they do require a consistent consciousness of how you are working. So, try to keep each of these in mind as you get ready for, and then during, each of your work sessions ü´∂

         <title>Did You Know In AVENGERS: ENDGAME</title>
         <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdCFQwBOdSo</link>
         <description>There is a moment that pays homage to another movie that centers around time travel. During the scene set in 2012 when one of the teams is present during the Battle of New York, when Tony finally gets the Tesseract and tries to make a break for it, his escape is interrupted by Hulk smashing through a door, which causes him to then lose the tesseract. This is referencing Back to the Future: Part 2, in which Marty McFly travels back to 1955 to the events of the first movie, and as when he has the sports almanac that he‚Äôs there to retrieve, he his hit to the floor by is younger self swinging a door open, which causes Biff to then reclaim the almanac for himself.

Up next, 5 ways to build an Alzheimer‚Äôs-resistant brain  ‚ñ∫ https://youtu.be/xBDGgovA1LI

It may not feel like it when you can't find your phone or &quot;lose&quot; your sunglasses sitting atop your head, but your memory is an amazing ability -- and one we want to protect. So it's little wonder that any blips or blank spaces can send us spiraling into concern. 

Some recall issues here and there are normal, says neuroscientist and author Lisa Genova, and not every lapse means looming problems. (And don't worry, forgetting names is a surprisingly tough thing for our brains to do!) But, Genova says, there's ways we can improve our memory, increase resilience and recall and be more comfortable with ourselves and our minds. 

From making lists and getting Google's help to giving yourself a pop quiz, getting some meditation in, and just plain paying attention, these tips will have your steel trap gleaming.

         <title>A Beginners Guide to eBPF Programming for Networking</title>
         <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=l5l2EckwWME&amp;feature=share</link>
         <description>eBPF has been described as ‚ÄúSuperpowers for Linux,‚Äù and recently we‚Äôve seen an explosion of tools that use it to power networking, observability and security in the Cloud Native world. It's an exciting technology that enables running bespoke programs directly in the kernel. In this talk Liz uses live-coding examples to explore how eBPF programs are loaded and run in the kernel, and attached to a variety of networking-related events. You might have seen Liz give a similar talk before, with examples hooking into system calls.

My Class on Studying Smarter, not Harder (exclusively on Nebula): https://nebula.tv/study-smarter-not-harder/1 

Accomplish more, be successful, and attack the day - these are the promises of what's in store for you if you become a morning person. I am not sure the promises necessarily hold. However, I have found waking up earlier has made me more productive, healthy, and happy because I have the extra time to do the things that make me productive, healthy, and happy. I now wake up at 5:30 every day, including on the weekends.

Who am I:

My name is Zach. I‚Äôm a fourth-year medical student in Philadelphia. I make videos about medical school, studying, and growth. I love trying new things and often mess up. However, every time I screw up I usually learn something. Whatever I learn I post it either on YouTube or on my website üåê  (https://zhighley.com/‚Äã‚Äã).

I write a weekly newsletter üíå (https://zhighley.com/newsletter/‚Äã‚Äã) linking the best things I read, watched, and listened to that week. Join the 4,000+ that read it every Sunday morning.

         <title>Obsidian As A Second Brain: The ULTIMATE Tutorial</title>
         <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=WqKluXIra70&amp;feature=share</link>
         <description>This is the only Obsidian tutorial you'll ever need, from start to finish. 

ü•≥ Sign up for my free productivity tips newsletter! ‚û°Ô∏è http://go.dabido.com.au/newsletter  

== DESCRIPTION == 
I'm dabi, a doctor and YouTuber, and I've made the single most in-depth YouTube guide to Obsidian on the internet. I've created this 13-part course that was initially $97, but now I've released it to you for free!

This is my opinionated guide to how I use Obsidian as a Second Brain and Zettelkasten. 
- Make Obsidian a digital Second Brain, so that you never ever forget anything you think about 
- Use Obsidian as a Zettelkasten 
- Capture thoughts extremely quickly, without worrying about structure until later 
- Use Obsidian's powerful search functions to find anything you've ever thought about 
- Synthesise and distill important ideas as part of a Zettelkasten, so that your most important thoughts are always top of mind 
- ...and more! 

I spent a ridiculous amount of time on this course (a *ridiculous* amount), because originally I set out to make the most in-depth paid course. 

üìö Make sure to bookmark it and share it with your friends, so you can come back to it as needed! There's no need to do it in one go, as originally it was meant to be done one lesson at a time. 

üéâ THIS VIDEO IS FULLY SUBTITLED. I've tried to make the subtitles as accurate as possible, to make things easier to understand, so I recommend turning them on. :) but I do apologise if I mess up here and there. 

00:00:00 - Once $97, now a YouTube video!  
00:00:36 - Introduction: Pages and Links
00:23:31 - Hashtags
00:27:52 - Links vs Hashtags
00:38:47 - The Obsidian Zettelkasten
00:53:46 - Search
01:07:14 - Special Formatting
01:16:33 - Dataviews in Obsidian
01:27:45 - Version Control
01:37:03 - Templates
01:40:43 - Backing Up Obsidian Files
01:42:49 - PDFs in Obsidian
01:45:31 - Plugins in Obsidian
01:58:02 - Yay, finished!

== WHO AM I? == 
I'm Dr David Liu - a medical doctor (specialised in General Practice/Family Medicine) and YouTuber who loves anime. :) My channel is about medicine, tech, note-taking software, books, anime, and AI! I nerd out a lot about ways to do things smarter and ways to create cool stuff.

Self-discipline is a wonderful thing. It can mean the difference between achieving goals and not achieving goals. It can give a person a greater sense of self-worth. It can allow someone the ability to work harder for a shorter amount of time and accomplish much more than before. Self-discipline can make the process of dropping bad habits in favor of good ones much easier to accomplish. People who have self-discipline are happier in life. They have a greater sense of purpose overall and a greater sense of accomplishment in everyday life. Seeking self-discipline is the best way to a better life.

Self-discipline is a goal that will only be accomplished by following a path that will cause a great deal of pain. Walking this path will require a good deal of hard work and dedication because this path is not an easy one to walk. Sometimes, people fall off. Sometimes, the direction of the path needs to be changed. Sometimes, the path needs to be broken up into smaller trips in order to be able to complete the whole journey.

Self-control and self-discipline require hard work and serious commitment. If a person is not really serious about the need to develop self-discipline, then it just will not happen. No one can give anyone else self-discipline. It needs to be learned within.

However, consider what happens if self-discipline is never developed. Can a person go on in life without ever developing any level of self-discipline? Of course they can. What they will be missing out on is a lifetime of achievement. They will be giving up all sense of self-worth and self-fulfillment. They will lose out on the ability to replace bad habits with good ones. They will never know the joy of getting rid of addictions and temptations. They will be forever plagued by negative feelings of anger and regret and guilt. They will live their entire lives accomplishing nothing because they lack the necessary self-discipline to accomplish anything. They will not succeed.

Of course, it is a purely personal choice. It is possible to live life without accomplishing anything. It is possible to just skate through life devoid of any sense of self-worth and self-love. It is possible to get to the end and never achieve any type of goal. However, what kind of life would that really be?

The best way is to begin today to work on personal goals. Start now by deciding which habits are bad and need to be replaced. Make a list of good habits that need to be cultivated. Decide when this new lifestyle will begin - keeping in mind that sooner is better. Write down all the goals that need to be achieved and all the good habits that need to be cultivated. Post this list where everyone can see it. Tell family and friends. Get everyone involved.

Most importantly, remember that a successful outcome will be its own best reward!

         <title>3 things I've learned after switching from iPad Pro to iPad Mini</title>
         <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl_Q19uSgmU</link>
         <description>I've been threatening to do this for a while... but I finally bit the bullet! I've traded in my iPad Pro 11&quot; and have been using the iPad Mini 6 for a month now. As a replacement device, it's not really felt like a downgrade! 

These are THREE BIG things I've learned in the process.

         <title>Infinite Banking Concept: Become Your Own Bank</title>
         <link>https://youtu.be/xbZ6iYDigYA</link>
         <description>The infinite banking concept (IBC) is a system whereby one becomes their own banker by growing their liquid cash value inside a properly-designed whole life insurance policy while borrowing against it to fund major expenditures, emergencies, and outside investment opportunities. 

The infinite banking concept is a strategy to use Whole Life insurance to become your own banker
Utilizing the infinite banking concept rather than traditional banks provides competitive safe growth rates, tax-sheltering, various protection benefits, and most importantly the continuous compounding of their liquid assets even while they‚Äôre being borrowed.

         <title>3 things I've learned after switching from iPad Pro to iPad Mini</title>
         <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=Fl_Q19uSgmU&amp;feature=share</link>
         <description>I've been threatening to do this for a while... but I finally bit the bullet! I've traded in my iPad Pro 11&quot; and have been using the iPad Mini 6 for a month now. As a replacement device, it's not really felt like a downgrade! 

These are THREE BIG things I've learned in the process.

         <title>(2) Standardizing Normally Distributed Random Variables - YouTube</title>
         <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=12s&amp;v=4R8xm19DmPM</link>
         <description>I discuss standardizing normally distributed random variables (turning variables with a normal distribution into something that has a standard normal distribution).  I work through an example of a probability calculation, and an example of finding a percentile of the distribution.  It is assumed that you can find values from the standard normal distribution, using either a table or a computer.  

The mean and variance of adult female heights in the US is estimated from data found in a National Health Statistics Report:

McDowell MA, Fryar CD, Ogden CL, Flegal KM. Anthropometric reference data for children and adults: United States, 2003-2006. National health statistics re- ports; no 10. Hyattsville, MD: National Center for Health Statistics. 2008.

For those using R, here is the R code for the examples used in this video:

American female heights example (approximately normally distributed with a mean of 162.2 and a standard deviation of 6.8).

Finding the probability that a randomly selected female is taller than 170.5 cm.
Easiest way: 
1-pnorm(170.5,162.2,6.8)
[1] 0.111121

Standardizing route:
1-pnorm((170.5-162.2)/6.8,0,1)
[1] 0.111121
The default in R's pnorm is the standard normal distribution (mean=0, SD=1), so the mean and SD can be left out when dealing with the standard normal.
1-pnorm((170.5-162.2)/6.8)
[1] 0.111121

Finding the probability that a randomly selected female has a height between 150.5 and 170.5.
Easiest way:
pnorm(170.5,162.2,6.8)-pnorm(150.5,162.2,6.8)
[1] 0.8462162

Standardizing route:
pnorm((170.5-162.2)/6.8)-pnorm((150.5-162.2)/6.8)
[1] 0.8462162

10th percentile of heights of adult American females.
Easiest:
qnorm(.1,162.2,6.8)
[1] 153.4854

Alternatively, via the standard normal distribution:
qnorm(.1)
[1] -1.281552
That's the 10th percentile of the standard normal distribution.  Converting to the distribution of heights,
-1.281552*6.8+162.2
[1] 153.4854</description>

         <description>One of the most annoying problems I face in my life is information overwhelm. I read all these books, listen to podcasts and watch YouTube videos and don't feel like I'm taking anything away from what I'm consuming.

         <title>Vertical Slice Architecture, not Layers!</title>
         <link>https://youtu.be/L2Wnq0ChAIA</link>
         <description>Why Vertical Slice Architecture? Nobody wants to deal with a system that is hard to change and easy to introduce bugs because it's a spaghetti code mess of various technical concerns. Clean Architecture is popular because it separates concerns into many different layers. But why are we organizing code by layers? Does adding a new feature require you to modify files across multiple projects in your UI, business, and data access layers? Vertical Slice Architecture is about how you organize code and focus on features instead of technical layers will make your system easier to change.

         <title>My time management setup in Obsidian (2023)</title>
         <link>https://youtu.be/V3-A6j17KsI</link>
         <description>My time management setup in Obsidian consists of a way to set goals, a daily note for rapid logging the present, and a review/retrospective system to evaluate past performance. In this video, I talk about all the plugins and apps I use to get all my responsibilities done-- without me feeling like I'm overwhelmed.

         <description>One of the best performance tips is &quot;do less&quot; - transmit less data and do less processing. There are a million details but we will focus on transmitting less JavaScript. We are going to tackle it by doing more work at build time which means we start with almost zero JavaScript and only load more as the users interacts with the page.

Tiago Forte, Founder of Forte Labs and author of &quot;Building A Second Brain,&quot; discusses the problem of information overload and how it can hinder creativity. 

He proposes a solution in the form of a Commonplace book, a central repository for all meaningful information and content. Forte's method for managing this information, called C.O.D.E. (capture, organize, distill, and express), allows individuals to access and use this information in order to facilitate creative thinking. 

By regularly reviewing the information in their Commonplace book and using it to inspire new ideas, individuals can more effectively navigate the overload of information in today's world and tap into their creativity.

It is a fast and simple action, basic to the higher-level arithmetic operations and directly supported by the processor. Most bitwise operations are presented as two-operand instructions where the result replaces one of the input operands.</description>

         <description>ASCII, abbreviated from American Standard Code for Information Interchange, is a character encoding standard for electronic communication. ASCII codes represent text in computers, telecommunications equipment, and other devices. Because of technical limitations of computer systems at the time it was invented, ASCII has just 128 code points, of which only 95 are printable characters, which severely limited its scope. All modern computer systems instead use Unicode, which has millions of code points, but the first 128 of these are the same as the ASCII set.</description>

         <link>https://youtu.be/OM0Xv0eVGtY</link>
         <description>Hello Brains! Having trouble Doing the Thing? You're not alone. Motivation is one of the biggest challenges most ADHDers face. This episode is all about how to fix Motivation Bridge. 

Special thanks to Doctor B from TakeThis.org for coming up with the clever phrase &quot;fill in the planks&quot; -- and for motivating me in so many ways.  

And of course, a giant thank you to my brilliant editors and animators Palestrina and JustCallMeGary for working tirelessly to help me bring Motivation Bridge to life (and making me cry). You should...you should sleep now.

         <title>Watch &quot;Re-thinking task management systems for my ADHD brain!&quot; on YouTube</title>
         <link>https://youtu.be/BcJlwtSxDfM</link>
         <description>The best task management system does not equal productivity. All my life when I struggled with completing tasks, I was told &quot;All you need is a good task management system! That will help you get things done&quot;. I started to believe that and now trying to work with my ADHD brain, I realize that task management systems is just that... a system that tracks your tasks. A good task management system needs these three basic things. 1.) Does it track your tasks? 2. Does it track when those tasks are due? And last, is it easy to access where ever you are. If your system does at least those three things, you have a good system. So now the real question is, what is going to make you do those tasks in your system?</description>

1. Carlos is at the swimming pool.
2. He walks to the locker room, carrying a towel.
3. He puts his watch in the towel and carries the towel tightly to a lounger at the poolside.
4. At the lounger he opens and vigorously shakes the towel, then walks to the snack bar.
5. He leaves the towel at the snack bar, then walks to the diving board.
6. Later Carlos realises he has has lost his watch. Where is the single most likely location of the watch?

Think through each step logically.

Imagine three different experts are answering this question.
They will brainstorm the answer step by step reasoning carefully and taking all facts into consideration
All experts will write down 1 step of their thinking,
then share it with the group.
They will each critique their response, and the all the responses of others
They will check their answer based on science and the laws of physics
Then all experts will go on to the next step and write down this step of their thinking.
They will keep going through steps until they reach their conclusion taking into account the thoughts of the other experts
If at any time they realise that there is a flaw in their logic they will backtrack to where that flaw occurred 
If any expert realises they're wrong at any point then they acknowledges this and start another train of thought
Each expert will assign a likelihood of their current assertion being correct
Continue until the experts agree on the single most likely location
The question is...</description>

         <title>From REST To GraphQL</title>
         <link>https://youtu.be/ntBU5UXGbM8</link>
         <description>As our applications grow larger, our REST architecture often becomes unmanageable. Custom endpoints and over/under fetching all become part of your life as a developer. Leave that behind and welcome GraphQL, a declarative and hierarchal way to fetch data, with just one endpoint to rule them all.
